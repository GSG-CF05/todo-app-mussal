## How to get the project to your local machine?

1. From the code green drop-down menu, you can choose **_Download ZIP_** and download it then extract it.
2. From the same menu, you can choose:

- If you don't have an secure key, choose HTTPS then copy the link in the box, after that go to the path you wish to save the file at and open your terminal, then type the command: `git clone /paste the link/`.
- If you have a secure key, just choose SSH and then do the same as the previous way.
